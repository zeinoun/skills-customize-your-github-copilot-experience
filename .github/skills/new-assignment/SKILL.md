# Create New Programming Assignment

Assignments live in `assignments/<id>/`, and the website reads `config.json` to display them. Follow these steps to create both.

## Step 1: Gather Requirements

If the user hasn't specified, ask what programming concept the assignment should cover.

> 📖 Read [references/assignment-guide.md](references/assignment-guide.md) for guidance on difficulty, scope, and when to include starter code.

## Step 2: Create the Assignment

1. Create `assignments/<kebab-case-id>/README.md` following the [assignment template](../../../templates/assignment-template.md)
2. (Optional) Add starter code or data files to the same directory

## Step 3: Register with the Website

Use the bundled scripts — do NOT edit `config.json` manually.

**Register the assignment:**

    node .github/skills/new-assignment/scripts/update-config.js <id> "<title>" "<description>"

**Register each file as an attachment** (starter code, data files, etc.):

    node .github/skills/new-assignment/scripts/add-attachment.js <id> "<display-name>" <filename> <type>

Common types: `python`, `csv`, `json`, `txt`, `html`

## Step 4: Verify

Confirm the assignment was registered correctly: check that `config.json` contains the new entry and that all created files exist on disk.
